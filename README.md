## Hi, I'm Milo 👋

## 🧩 A Little Bit About Me

As a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a diverse background in Anthropology, Conflict Resolution, Activism and Financial Crime Investigation, I bring a unique perspective to technology development. My experience spans the NGO and banking sectors, where I’ve honed my ability to merge systematic analysis with human insight to solve complex problems while prioritising meaningful impact.

I’ve transitioned from ESG policy research to financial crime investigations, to building innovative full-stack applications that deliver user-focused solutions. My experience in pattern recognition and systematic analysis drives me to create applications that are not only efficient but also impactful for the intended user groups.

I am actively seeking opportunities as a Junior Software Engineer — whether in a full-time role or freelance capacity — where I can leverage my diverse background and technical expertise while continuing to grow as a developer. I am particularly drawn to organisations that value creative human-centred approaches to problem-solving.

## 💻 Technical Skills

I have experience across the full stack, with a focus on creating seamless user experiences and scalable solutions. My technical toolkit includes:

## 🚀 My Approach

I thrive on creating solutions that blend technical precision with a deep understanding of human needs. Whether building a dynamic web application or optimising backend functionality, I aim to deliver products that solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences.

## 🌱 What I’m Learning Next

### Ruby & Ruby on Rails
I’m diving into Ruby to expand my skills and explore the power of the Ruby on Rails framework. Ruby’s simplicity and elegance make it a fantastic language for building robust web applications, and I’m excited to integrate Rails into my full-stack development toolkit. By learning Ruby first, I aim to develop a solid foundation in object-oriented programming and clean, maintainable code, which will set me up for success when tackling Rails projects.

### Exploring Jest for Automated Testing
While I’ve gained valuable experience with manual testing during development, I’m now exploring Jest to streamline my workflow and improve testing efficiency. Automated testing not only saves time but also ensures code reliability, especially in larger applications. I’m excited to learn how to write comprehensive test suites that cover both functionality and edge cases, making my development process smoother and more effective.
